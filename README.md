## 🛠️ For Developers

If you want to run the application from the source code or contribute to its development, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Git

### Running from Source

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/carvalinh0/Youtube-Music-RPC.git
    cd Youtube-Music-RPC
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

### Building the Executable

This project uses `PyInstaller` to create a single-file executable for Windows. The build configuration is already set up in the GitHub Actions workflow.

To build it locally (with debug console), run the following command from the project root:

```sh
pyinstaller --onefile --icon=icon.ico --add-data "script.js;." --add-data "window.py;." --add-data "discordRPC.py;." --add-data "icon.png;." --add-data "icon.ico;." main.py -n "Youtube Music"
```

The final executable will be located in the `dist/` directory.

## 🔮 Potential Improvements

This project is fully functional, but there are always opportunities for enhancement. Here are a few known ideas:

- **Cross-Platform Builds:** The current build process is configured only for Windows. GitHub Actions could be expanded to build versions for macOS and Linux.
- **System Tray Icon:** Instead of just closing, the application could be minimized to the system tray for a more seamless background experience. This would allow users to show/hide the window easily.
- **Pause/Play State:** The Rich Presence could be enhanced to show a "Paused" icon or state when the music is paused in the player, rather than just clearing the status.
- **Better Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling for cases where the Discord client is not running or the connection is lost, with options to reconnect automatically.
- **Configuration File:** Add a simple script in the site to allow users to set preferences, such as whether the app should start minimized or if the debug console should be enabled.
- **Optimizations:** The actual code has some known issues that could be optimized for better performance and user experience.
- **Listen my actual music support:** Add a button to listen the song that other users are listening to.
- **Listen with me support:** Add support to listen the same songs as your friend (hard one).
