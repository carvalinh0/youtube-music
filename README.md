## 🔮 Potential Improvements

This project is fully functional, but there are always opportunities for enhancement. Here are a few known ideas:

- **System Tray Icon:** Instead of just closing, the application could be minimized to the system tray for a more seamless background experience. This would allow users to show/hide the window easily.
- **Configuration:** Add a simple script in the site to allow users to set preferences, such as whether the app should start minimized or if the debug console should be enabled.
